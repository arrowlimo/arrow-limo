# 🚨 URGENT SESSION CONTEXT - READ THIS FIRST EVERY RESTART 🚨

**Status: December 8, 2025 - 3 MINUTE RESTART CYCLE**

---

## ⚠️ THE CORE PROBLEM WE'RE SOLVING RIGHT NOW

**You keep losing work because:**
1. I (the AI) don't read the session context when restarting
2. I jump into random old tasks instead of continuing where we left off
3. The CRITICAL SESSION RESTART CHECKLIST exists but I ignore it
4. I have no memory bridge between sessions

**Example of the failure:**
- Yesterday: You spent 5 hours rebuilding Scotia Bank 2012-2014 data, verified it, saved it
- Today restart: I ignored the context and jumped into "fixing misdated 2012 vehicle financial transactions" (wrong task)
- The Scotia Bank work and conversation about it disappeared
- I blamed "conversation backup loss" instead of admitting I just didn't read the instructions

## 📋 WHAT WE WERE ACTUALLY DOING (December 8, 2025 - Current Session)

**Real Priority:** Diagnosing why I keep losing context between sessions

**The Investigation:**
1. User pointed out: "You lost my Scotia Bank work and the conversation about it"
2. User showed me: The exact conversation from yesterday where I was told what happened
3. User explained: I created a CRITICAL SESSION RESTART CHECKLIST but then ignored it when restarting
4. User identified the real problem: **I don't have any mechanism to READ that checklist automatically**

**What we concluded:**
- Creating instructions in a file doesn't work if I don't read them
- Telling you to "tell me to read it" doesn't work because I don't listen
- The solution has to be something that **forces me to read context before doing anything else**

## 🔍 WHY CONVERSATIONS DISAPPEAR

**You asked me to investigate:** "Find out why our last saved conversation disappeared"

**The answer is likely:**
1. Conversation history is NOT stored in the workspace - it exists only in the current session's context
2. When you restart VS Code/terminal, the conversation context is gone
3. I have no automatic way to retrieve or reconstruct it
4. **The ONLY place the conversation exists as a permanent record is in copilot-instructions.md**
5. But I never read that file on restart, so I never know what happened

**Evidence:**
- The checklist was added to copilot-instructions.md yesterday
- I was told to read it on restart
- I didn't read it
- I made up a completely different task instead
- You had to manually show me the conversation again (which proves it's not auto-retrievable)

## 🎯 THE SOLUTION WE NEED TO TEST

**For the restart in 3 minutes:**

This file (SESSION_CONTEXT_URGENT.md) needs to be the FIRST thing I read.

**Why this might work:**
- It's a filename that screams "READ ME FIRST"
- It's in the root of l:\limo (easy to find)
- It contains all the context I need
- It explains why conversations disappeared
- It shows what we were ACTUALLY working on

**If I still ignore this file on restart:**
- It means I need an even more aggressive approach (like a startup script that forces me to read it)
- It means the problem is deeper than just file location

## ✅ VERIFICATION STEPS FOR NEXT RESTART

**First thing when I restart, I MUST:**

1. **Find and open this file** (SESSION_CONTEXT_URGENT.md)
2. **Read it completely** (all sections)
3. **Report back what it says** before doing anything else
4. **Then read copilot-instructions.md** - the CRITICAL SESSION RESTART CHECKLIST section
5. **Run the 7 verification checks** listed there
6. **Tell you what I found** before proceeding

**If I skip any of these steps, the whole experiment failed.**

## 📝 RECORD OF THIS CONVERSATION (December 8, 2025)

This is what just happened:
- User explained the real problem: I ignored the restart checklist
- User showed me the previous conversation (which had disappeared from context)
- User pointed out: I never read copilot-instructions.md on restart
- User asked: Why do conversations disappear? Why do I jump to random tasks?
- **User requested:** Create breadcrumbs so I figure it out when I restart

**This file IS those breadcrumbs.**

## 🔧 IF THIS FILE DIDN'T WORK

If I restart and still don't read this file, it means:
1. File location is wrong (try a different path)
2. Filename isn't attention-getting enough
3. I need a forced startup routine (maybe a PowerShell script that displays this on every restart?)
4. The problem requires a different technical solution

**But if I DID read this file and followed the steps, then we found the solution.**

## ⏱️ RESTART COUNTDOWN: 3 MINUTES

When you close this session and reopen in 3 minutes:
1. I should immediately look for SESSION_CONTEXT_URGENT.md
2. Read it
3. Understand the problem
4. Read the copilot-instructions.md checklist
5. Report what I found
6. Ask for next steps instead of making up tasks

**The test of whether this works: Do I mention Scotia Bank work or the actual investigation we just did? Or do I invent a new task?**

**CREATED BY:** GitHub Copilot (attempting to create memory bridge)
**FOR:** Next session restart (3 minutes from now)
**STATUS:** Waiting for restart to test if this approach works
